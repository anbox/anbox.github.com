                            Anbox puts the Android operating system into a container, abstracts
                            hardware access and integrates core system services into a GNU/Linux
                            system. Every Android application will be integrated with your
                            operating system like any other native application.

                            containers (LXC) to separate the Android operating system from
                            the host. Any Android version is suitable for this approach
                            and we try to keep up with the latest available version
                            from the Android Open Source Project.

                          an emulator to run the Android environment. The emulator creates an entire
                          emulated system which has its own kernel etc whereas Anbox runs the Android
                          system under the same kernel as the host operating system does. No emulation
                          layer like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.qemu-project.org/">QEMU</a>
                          is necessary. Everything runs directly on the hardware. This approach
                          also allows a much better integration with the host operating system.

                            Yes, this is generally possible. However Google doesn't allow anyone
                            to ship its applications as long as the device is not certified and the
                            vendor didn't sign an agreement with Google.

                            There is no easy way yet for a user to install applications into the

                            When you have adb installed on your host system you can install applications
                            like this:
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono; padding: 10px 0 5px 0;">

                        <p>
                            Afterwards your application should be installed as part of the Anbox runtime
                            and can be launched via the host system application launcher.

                        <p>
                            Google is implementing support in Chrome OS for Android
                            applications in a very similar way as we do. Both approaches
                            are quite similar as both put Android into a lightweight
                            system container based on Linux namespaces and keep a small
                            bridge to allow communication with the host system.
                        </p>
                        <p> In contrast to Google's implementation, Anbox doesn't
                            allow any direct access to hardware devices. For example it bridges Open GL
                            ES to the host. In Chrome OS the container gets access to the
                            host kernel side of the graphic subsystem to allow fast
                            rendering. In our case, we decided against this to keep an easy
                            way to port Anbox to different platforms. All a host operating
                            system needs to provide is a Open GL / Open GL ES compatible
                            driver to provide proper integration
                            with the graphics subsystem. Other hardware devices like WiFi
                            or Bluetooth will be abstracted in the future via a dedicated
                            APIs between the container and the host.

                            As we provide a complete Android system generally all
                            applications are supposed to work. However there are a few

                                    If your application depends on particular hardware
                                    functionality like WiFi, Bluetooth or telephony, we need
                                    additional work to bridge those over from the host system. As
                                    of right now the only thing you can do is to ensure your
                                    application behaves correct when these functionalities are not
                                    available.

                                    Anbox uses the freeform mode introduced with Android 7
                                    which allows a multi-window system. Your applications
                                    needs to play well within the freeform mode to work
                                    well in Anbox. You can find more details in the

                            Most likely it's not your fault. Anbox is still in its early days
                            and doesn't have much test coverage across a wide range of different
                            systems yet. If Anbox doesn't start for you, please follow the
                            instructions <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anbox/anbox/issues/new">
                            here</a> and file a bug report so that a developer can look into the problem.

                            The initial proof-of-concept was done on an

                            based device. Since then Anbox has evolved quite a bit, making desktop devices its main
                            development focus. However, recent experiments show that Anbox still runs fine (with a few
                            tweaks and lifted confinement because of older kernel versions) on mobile devices based on
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubuntu.com/mobile">Ubuntu Touch</a>.

                            Anbox is currently only distributed as a snap as snaps makes the life
                            for us developers pretty easy. They allow us fast and easy packaging,
                            easy distribution to our users, as well as regular and fast updates.

                            would be another alternative but we didn't investigate this yet, nor
                            are we planing to do so in the near future. However, we're happy to
                            accept contributions from the community around Anbox to provide necessary
                            changes to distribute Anbox as a flatpak package too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One thing which Anbox currently doesn't do is using proper confinement
                            for <a target='_blank' href='https://snapcraft.io/'>snaps</a>. Right now it is
                            only usable when installed in the so-called devmode of snaps which disables any
                            confinement. This is something we will work on over the coming months with upstream
                            to allow our snap to be fully confined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite snap confinement being disabled, the Android system
                            still stays separate through the use of <a

                            the host system.

                        <p>
                            No. Anbox does not need a specific Android image for every
                            device as it is specifically built in a device independent
                            way. Anbox will ship with a single Android image per
                            architecture (amd64, armhf, arm64) and no device specifc
                            modifications are required.
